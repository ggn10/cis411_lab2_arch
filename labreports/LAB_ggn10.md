# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] I have reviewed the [lecture / discussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve Central offers a software solution to the problem of the decline of volunteer service in the United States. It allows aspiring volunteers to have all of the volunteer registration and event information in one simple application.

## Step 2.1 Representative Use Cases  

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Register for Volunteer Event |
| Description | This use case describes how a user would register for a volunteer event. |
| Primary Actor | Volunteer User |
| Preconditions |  1. User is authenticated 2. Registration application is available and online |
| Steps | 1. User opens the application 2. User selects 'Register for Event' button 3. User verifies their personal information 4. System stores their user and event information 5. System notifies the user their registration status |
| Postconditions | 1. New registration is created and stored in database 2. Volunteer event capacity updated |

| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title | |
| Description / Steps | |
| Primary Actor | |
| Preconditions | |
| Postconditions | |

## Step 2.2 Define the MVC Components

# Step 3: Enhancing an Architecture

## Step 3.1 Architecture Change Proposal
INSERT Architectural change proposal here, and how it meets the two new requirements.  Explain both the benefits and draw backs of your proposal.

## Step 3.2 Revised Architecture Diagram
INSERT IMAGE HERE with a Description.

# Step 4: Scaling an Architecture
INSERT Architectural change proposal here, and how it meets the four new requirements.  Explain both the benefits and draw backs of your proposal.  If the changes are significant, then you need to explain why the changes are necessary versus a nice-to-have enhancement.
